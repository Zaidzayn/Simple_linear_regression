A Hands-on Repository for Simple, Multiple & Polynomial Regression using Python



🚀 About this Repository
Welcome to the Regression Algorithms Playground!
This repository demonstrates the fundamentals of regression analysis using three common approaches:

✅ Simple Linear Regression
✅ Multiple Linear Regression
✅ Polynomial Regression

Each model is built from scratch with detailed explanations, visualizations, and practical datasets to make learning regression models intuitive and enjoyable.

🔥 What You'll Learn
Regression Type	Purpose	Use Case Example
Simple Linear Regression	Predicting a target from 1 feature	Predict height from weight
Multiple Linear Regression	Predicting from multiple features	Predict house price from area, rooms, location
Polynomial Regression	Fitting non-linear data curves	Predicting growth trends
